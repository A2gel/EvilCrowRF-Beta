The developers and collaborators of this project do not earn money with this. 
You can invite me for a coffee to further develop Low-Cost hacking devices. If you don't invite me for a coffee, nothing happens, I will continue developing devices.

# Disclaimer

Evil Crow RF is a basic device for professionals and cybersecurity enthusiasts.

We are not responsible for the incorrect use of Evil Crow RF.

We recommend using this device for testing, learning and fun :D

# Introduction

Evil Crow RF is a radiofrequency hacking device for pentest and Red Team operations, this device operates in the following radiofrequency bands:

* 300Mhz-348Mhz
* 387Mhz-464Mhz
* 779Mhz-928Mhz

Evil Crow RF uses 2 CC1101 modules, these modules can be configured to transmit or receive on different frequencies at the same time.

Evil Crow RF allows the following attacks:

* Signal receiver
* Signal Transmitter
* Replay attacks
* ...

**This device is similar to the device developed by Samy Kamkar (@samykamkar):** https://www.wired.com/2015/08/hackers-tiny-device-unlocks-cars-opens-garages/

In this repository you can find a basic PCB to mount your own Evil Crow RF **(the full version of Evil Crow RF is still under development).**

In this repository you can also find some BASIC sketches for Evil Crow RF. **Sketches for replay or rolljam attacks are not published for ethical reasons.**
